# Dental-App
### Dental App Bachelor project

 Within the framework of this bachelor project concept, I have familiarized myself with the technologies of the Microsoft .NET Framework,
acquired new knowledge in the field of programming and dealt with a project from practice.
Microsoft Visual Studio is used as an integrated development environment and main tool for coding. 
C# programming language is used to write the web application in ASP.NET core. 
Visual Studio provides excellent support for many types of 
- server-side like using C# on ASP.NET 
 
- client-side frameworks like Angular

This project to develop a web-based application for dental practices is organized in the domain style. This means that the larger functions of the application are arranged in modules and handled under folders of the same name. All components are present in the domain structure in one module. This creates the modular structure of this web app.
